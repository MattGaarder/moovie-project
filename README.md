## Description movie-search
The website allows user to search for movies with its title, watch a trailer from yourtube, and store them as (i) a list of movies that they want to watch in the future, or (ii) the ones that they have already seen and want to keep a record of.

## Design
The concept is based on using OMDbapi and youtube by linking together a movie profile, provided by OMBd API, and youtube trailer. The user can click on 'watch' or 'seen' buttons, browse through the history list, delete from both lists.

## Value added
Movie-search is created to address the users' need to create own library and store in one place movies coming from different sources: refecenced by reviewers, advertised in media, spread by the word of mouth or similar. The user can go into one place to keep the record of movie memorabilia.
